# let PET point to your PET ROM directory e.g.:
# PET=/Users/home/Vice/ROMS

# Make sure to change all ROM and keyboard settings in the
# Ressource Inspector of VICE at the same time!
# Don't care, if the PET crashes during the changes, it is normal
# if you change the ROM's of a running system :-)

# Choose basic.new instead of basic4
# Choose kernal.new instead of kernal4
# Choose edit.new instead of edit4b80
# Choose chargen.new instead of chargen.de
# Choose osx_sym_de.vkm as virtual keyboard

# Set the memory size of the PET to 128K
# Set the I/O size to 256 byte

# SAVE CURRENT SETTINGS

# Quit VICE and start it again.
